Disney Cruise Planning for Geeks

This is a step by step guide to planning a 1-week Disney cruise.  

We have been on several Disney cruises, including:
- The Disney Magic in the Caribbean: Port Canaveral, Key West, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, Castaway Cay (early closing due to weather)
- The Disney Fantasy with Star Wars Day at Sea: Port Canaveral, Cozumel, Grand Cayman, Castaway Cay (canceled due to weather)
- The Disney Magic in Norway: Copenhagen, Stavanger, Alesund, Geiranger, Bergen
- The Disney Fantasy with Star Wars Day at Sea: Port Canaveral, Tortola, St. Thomas, Castaway Cay

Step 1: Choose your itinierary and room
Book well in advance!  Where do you want to go?  
A few tips:
- The Deluxe Family Oceanview Stateroom with Verandah is a great choice if you're looking for a mid-level option.  Or, check out the Deluxe Family Oceanview Stateroom if you don't care about a balcony.  The two-room bathroom makes life easier.
- Try to get a cabin midship, or closer to the kids' clubs, if you have children.
- Cruisecritic.com has very informative and helpful cabin reviews.  If you can't find a review for your exact ship and cabin, you can check the review for the same cabin on the sister ship: Magic/Wonder, or Fantasy/Dream.
- The adults in our family prefer more days in port to explore new cultures, while the children prefer more days at sea to enjoy the ship's activities and kids' club.  You can decide what's best for your family!
- The smaller ships and larger ships each have their own advantages.  Don't let ship size be the determining factor.

Step 2: Choose early or late seating when you book the cruise
- This blog covers the pros and cons nicely: http://magicaldistractions.com/disney-cruise-dinner-seating/
- We chose late seating for our first few cruises, but found it disruptive to go to a show, then dinner, have the kids Dine & Play for a few minutes, and then pick them up for bedtime.  We're trying early seating next time.
- If you don't get your first choice, ask to be put on the wait list.

Step 3: Figure out when you can book your cruise activities.  Use this calculator:

Be sure to pay your cruise balance in advance, and be ready to book activities on the first day you can, if you're highly motivated to book certain activities.

Step 3: Research the port adventures in advance.
You can find sample activities for each port of call at https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/port-adventures/overview/, even before your booking window is open.  Choose your top 2-3 port adventures for each day, just in case your favorite is not available.

Step 4: Deduce when special evening activities will take place.
How do you know when the evening activities will occur?
- Evening activities will show up in your daily cruise planner when your booking window opens.
- There will be a Sail Away Deck Party on the first night of the cruise.  Enjoy music and dancing with Disney characters.
- If you're on a Star Wars Day at Sea cruise, that will be one of the days at Sea, of course.  
   - Star Wars costumes are highly encouraged, but not required.  
   - If you're a Star Wars fan, don't plan any book-in-advance activities other than the Star Wars character meet-and-greets for that day.  
   - The Star Wars character meet-and-greets are scheduled via a lottery system after you get on board.  Don't forget to select your top meet-and-greet choices and turn in your selections promptly!  
   - The Star Wars Day at Sea includes a special dinner menu.  It also includes a dance party in the evening, with fireworks.
- Pirate Night is a feature of Caribbean cruises.  Pirate costumes are highly encouraged, but not required.  It includes a fun pirate-themed dinner with a rowdy pirate "invasion", so I recommend avoiding the adults-only Palo and Remy dinners on Pirate Night.  On our cruise that included Pirate Night but not the Star Wars Day at Sea, Pirate Night also included an evening show on deck with fireworks.
- The Frozen Deck Party is a feature of European cruises, and it replaces the Pirate Night.  It includes fake snow instead of fireworks.
- Save the last night of the cruise for packing up.  You'll need to repack a smaller bag for overnight, and your main bag will be taken away at dinner time, not to be seen again until after you disembark.  This is not a great night for Palo or Remy reservations.
- If you eliminate the nights with special evening activities, you will know which nights are best for Palo or Remy reservations.
- Brunch reservations are also available on certain days, at Palo or Remy.

Step 5: Book your port adventures
When your booking window opens, choose your favorite port adventures right away.  Most port adventures can be cancelled or re-scheduled up to 3 days before your cruise departs, but a few cannot be changed.

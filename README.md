Disney Cruise Planning for Geeks

This is a step by step guide to planning a 1-week Disney cruise.  
We have been on several cruises, including two Disney cruises in the Caribbean, one in Norway, and one Star Wars Day At Sea.

Step 1: Choose your itinierary and room
Book well in advance!  Where do you want to go?  
A few tips:
- The Deluxe Family Oceanview Stateroom with Verandah is a great choice if you're looking for a mid-level option.  Or, check out the Deluxe Family Oceanview Stateroom if you don't care about a balcony.  The two-room bathroom makes life easier.
- Try to get a cabin midship or closer to the kids' clubs if you have children.  Deck 7 is our favorite.
- Cruisecritic.com has very informative and helpful cabin reviews.  If you can't find a review for your exact ship and cabin, you can check the review for the same cabin on the sister ship: Magic/Wonder, or Fantasy/Dream.
- The adults in our family prefer more days in port to explore new cultures, while the children prefer more days at sea to enjoy the ship's activities and kids' club.  You can decide what's best for your family!
- The smaller ships and larger ships each have their own advantages.  Don't let the ship size be the determining factor.

Step 2: Choose early or late seating
- This blog covers the pros and cons nicely: http://magicaldistractions.com/disney-cruise-dinner-seating/
- We chose late seating for our first few cruises, but found it disruptive to go to a show, then dinner, have the kids Dine & Play, and then pick them up (often quite late) for bedtime.  We're trying early seating next time.
- If you don't get your first choice, ask to be put on the wait list.

Step 3: Figure out when you can book your cruise activities.  Use this calculator:

Be sure to pay your cruise balance in advance, and be ready to book activities on your first day if you're highly motivated to get certain activities.

Step 3: Research the port adventures in advance.
You can find sample activities for each port of call at https://disneycruise.disney.go.com, even before your booking window is open.  Choose your top 2-3 port adventures for each day, just in case your favorite is not available.

Step 4: Deduce when special evening activities will take place.
How do you know when the evening activities will occur?
- There will be a Sail Away Deck Party on the first night of the cruise.  It's a lot of fun if you like music and dancing with Disney characters.
- If you're on a Star Wars Day at Sea cruise, that will be one of the days at Sea (of course).  If you're a Star Wars fan, you won't want to plan any book-in-advance activities other than the Star Wars character meet-and-greets for that day.  The Star Wars character meet-and-greets are scheduled via a lottery system after you get on board.  Don't forget to select your top choices and turn in your selections promptly!
- Pirate Night will show up on your cruise planner at https://disneycruise.disney.go.com when it's time to book activites.  You have to click on each day to find the on with Pirate Night listed.  This is a fun dinner, and I recommend avoiding the adults- only Palo and Remy dinners on Pirate Night.
- Save the last night of the cruise for packing up.  You'll need to repack a smaller bag for overnight, and your main bag will be taken away at dinner time, not to be seen again until after you disembark.  This is not a great night for Palo or Remy reservations.
